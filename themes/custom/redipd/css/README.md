CSS
---

Please don't edit any style in this folder, base or custom styles must be in 
Sass folder. If Gulp compiles, or someone do a clean task, you can lose your 
changes even if they are in a new css file.

main.css is intended to save changes resulting from the compilation of sass 
files through Gulp.
If you create another .sass file in /src/sass, this file also will be compiled
into this directory.
