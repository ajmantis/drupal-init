In this folder, we have our sass directory, inside it you can find more 
information about our Sass structure and a correct usage. Read the README.md 
in sass directory if you don't know yet how to customize the theme with your 
own styles.

To start changing the styles, you need to have fulfilled all the requirements 
and to have followed all the steps of the instructions explained in the main 
README.md file (located in Da Vinci theme root directory).
